Factory Design Pattern â€“ Game Character Example

This project demonstrates the **Factory Design Pattern** in TypeScript using a simple game character creation example.  

Factory Creational Design Pattern:

The **Factory Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** that provides a centralized way to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.  

Instead of creating objects directly with `new`, the client delegates this responsibility to a **factory class**, which decides which concrete implementation to return.
