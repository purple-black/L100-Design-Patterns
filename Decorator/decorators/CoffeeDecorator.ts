// Base Decorator
// This class implements the Coffee interface and wraps
// another Coffee object.
// It's abstract because it is not used directly â€” we extend it
// to create specific decorators. This is not called directly form the main.ts and the protected coffee can be assecible
// its subclasses and this class cannot be instantiated directly by external code
